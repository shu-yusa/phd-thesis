\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Kouichi Hagino for his continuous support
of my research throughout the period of graduate school.
His suggestions and advices on my research were indispensable for me
to reach a certain goal of this project.
Daily discussion about nuclear physics had been very useful for proceeding my
research.
I would like to thank him also for many instructive advices after
seminars, conferences and so on.

I would like to thank Prof. Shoichi Sasaki for fruitful discussions.
I am very grateful for his advices on physics and seeking for my jobs.
I would like to thank Dr. Akira Ono for consultation about computation.
His advices on parallelization technique and computational troubles were 
indispensable for pursuing actual calculations.
I thank all the other members of the nuclear theory group
for daily discussions on various topics.
These discussions were greatly instructed me and useful for my study and
research activities.

This work was supported by the Global COE Program
``Weaving Science Web beyond Particle-Matter Hierarchy'' at
